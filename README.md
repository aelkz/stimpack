## 📊 Daily Supplement Schedule

| Time of Day | Supplement(s) | Dose | With Food? | Notes |
|---|---|---:|:---:|---|
| **Morning** | Solaray Tongkat Ali | 400 mg | ⚠️ Empty | Main T-support; many report better effect on empty stomach. |

|  | Fish Oil | 2 caps (≈1500 mg EPA + 750 mg DHA) | ✅ | Lipids & anti-inflammatory support. |
|  | **Boron** | **3 mg** | ✅ | Most evidence-based doses are 3–10 mg/day. If your label shows “300 mg,” verify elemental boron (likely **3 mg**). |
|  | EGCg (Green Tea Extract) | 400 mg | ✅ | Take with breakfast to reduce nausea; supports fat oxidation. |
| **Pre-Workout (30–40 min before)** | Beta-Alanine | 3 g | ❌ | Tingling is normal; benefits come from daily saturation. |

|  | Citrulline Malate | 3 g | ❌ | Pumps/endurance; consider 6–8 g if you want a stronger effect. |
|  | Fenugreek | 1,500 mg | Either | May aid T & glucose control; OK fed or fasted. |
| **Lunch** | Creatine Monohydrate | 3 g | ✅ | Pair with carbs/protein to assist uptake. |
| **Afternoon (Pre-Walk 30–45 min)** | EGCg (Green Tea Extract) | 400 mg | ✅ | With your small meal (≈25P/≈20C/low-fat) to support fat use during the 1 h walk. |
| **Dinner** | Creatine Monohydrate | 2 g | ✅ | Keeps daily total at **~5 g** (kidney-friendly cap). |
|  | TestoJack *(optional, if cycling)* | 1 cap (~300 mg blend) | ✅ | **Do not** stack daily with Tongkat. Alternate/cycle if you use it. |

## ⚠️ Vault-Tec Advisory

- **Tongkat Ali vs. TestoJack:** Use **Tongkat Ali daily** as your main T-support. If you like TestoJack, run it in **cycles** (e.g., 4–8 weeks on, then off) **instead of** Tongkat during that period.
- **Creatine & kidneys:** Cap total at **3–5 g/day**. The table shows **3 g lunch + 2 g dinner** (~5 g total).
- **EGCg ceiling:** Keep **≤ 800 mg/day** (400 mg AM + 400 mg pre-walk). Consider **6–8 weeks on**, then **reduce to 400 mg/day for ~4 weeks** before repeating.
- **Mineral interactions:** Don’t take **ZMA** with calcium-rich foods/supps. Separate by 2+ hours.
